## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

The challegne was for me an opportunity to learn basics of Styled Components and practice using CSS custom properties. Also creating a three way toggle switch in React was another challenge and huge amount of learning, especially because it's my first project using React Hooks. I am happy I managed to fulfill a bonus task as well.

### Continued development

In the future I'd like to make possible using key events for entering numbers and choosing operations in the app.
